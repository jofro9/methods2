# Part A
```{r a}
model1 = glm(copd ~ age + gender + smoker + BMI + BMIsquared, data = data, family = binomial)
summary(model1)
t_w = summary(model1)$coefficients[6, 3]
p_w = 2*(1-pnorm(test_statistic))

```

# Part B
```{r b}
model0 = glm(copd ~ age + gender + smoker + BMI, data = data, family = binomial)
t_lr = (-2 * log(exp(logLik(model0)) / exp(logLik(model1))))[1]
df = 1
p_lr = pchisq(t_lr, df, lower.tail = F)

```

# Part C
Yes.

# Part D
Since we are using a higher order term for BMI, in order to avoid high correlation between BMI and its higher order term, BMI square, we should center the variable.
